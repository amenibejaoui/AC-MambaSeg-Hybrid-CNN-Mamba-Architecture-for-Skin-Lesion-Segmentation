AC-MambaSeg is a deep learning model designed for accurate skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images.
It combines an encoderâ€“decoder structure with spatial and channel attention mechanisms and the Mamba architecture to capture both local
features and long-range dependencies, making it well-suited for complex medical image analysis.

This project uses the following datasets [ISIC 2018 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hungvumanh/isic-18-numpy) 
and the  [PH2 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hashbanger/ph2-dataset)  available on Kaggle.
To download it, make sure you have the Kaggle API installed
